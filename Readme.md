#This code defines two classes: Member and Esusu. The Member class represents a single member in an Esusu group and stores their name and contribution amount. The Esusu class represents the Esusu group itself and maintains a list of its members. The Esusu class also provides methods to add members, calculate the total contribution, and distribute the funds equally among the members.

##This code should give you a good starting point for building your Esusu app. You can modify and extend the code to add more functionality as needed.
